* What does the app do? 
    This is our interpretation of Amazon.
    * What problem does it solve? Who uses it?
    * Why was it built?
    * User Inputs and Outputs
* Tech stack ( you can include logos)
   We used React, Brainhub Carousel, Express, Mongoose, CSS, bootstrap

* Challenges that were unexpect
Our user expected to visit our site and browse items to purchase, view questions, see sponsored products, and read reviews. The user wants to be able to add items to the cart and see a subtotal

* What research was required? 
  Mongo/mongoose was a new database for most of us so we needed to do quite a bit of research and refactoring to achieve an efficient datwabase. We discovered tools such as Compass and Atlas to make database management quite a bit easier

For the carousel component, I want to refactor the database deletion and seeding functions to be able to easily alter my database in the future.
